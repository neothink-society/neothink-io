# Neothink+

> After 50+ years operating as an underground success network, we are now passing the keys to the kingdom to a new generation of value creators, integrated thinkers, and self-leaders.

## Identity

- **Name:** Neothink+
- **Type:** Administrative Portal for the Neothink Ecosystem
- **Domain:** neothink.io
- **Tagline:** "Prosper Happily Forever" | "Go Further, Faster, Forever"
- **Founded:** 1968 (I & O Publishing) | 2007 (Neothink Society) | 2024 (Public Launch)

## Who We Are

We are the architects of a self-evolutionary movement focused on preserving the ultimate value in the universe: human consciousness. Our identity is defined by the Neothink mentality—a mental modality that shatters the "following mode" and replaces it with self-leadership and value creation.

**Core Identities:**
- **Value Creators:** Individuals who build new knowledge and wealth through original contributions
- **Integrated Thinkers:** Those who snap together puzzle pieces to reveal reality others cannot see
- **Self-Leaders:** People who operate as the ultimate authority over their own lives

## Leadership

- **Dr. Frank R. Wallace** (1932-2006): Founder of Neo-Tech (1968). Former DuPont research chemist who resigned in 1972 to cure the "disease of irrationality." Created the integrated thinking philosophy.
- **Mark Hamilton**: Current leader. Founder of Neothink Society (2007). Author of 30+ works including the 1,100-page Superpuzzle. Made the historic decision to go public in 2024.
